🔢 Task description
Your task is to train a model that recognizes a number pronounced in an input audio clip.
💽 Data
You are given the training dataset that consists of 9,000 audio clips. Each clip contains a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1,000,000 (exclusive) that is pronounced by male or female voice.
In the dataset folder you will find a train.csv file that contains the following columns:
path - path to an audio file in wav format
gender - a gender of the voice that pronounced this audio clip
number - a number that was pronounced
⚠️ Only 3,000 audio clips are labeled.
📈 Evaluation
We will measure character error rate (CER) between the predictions of your model and the ground truth numbers. The lower CER, the better.
⚠️ The test set contains noisy samples recorded by different people.
📦 Requirements
You must provide a script that takes a csv file with paths to audio clips and produce a new csv file with your model predictions. That file must contain two columns: path and number.

Model size should be not greater than 2 MB.

We expect you to create a GitHub repo with all your code (python + pytorch), a README.md file that contains links to a model checkpoint as well as a detailed description of your approach and  how to use it.

We understand that you are a busy person and likely will not want to spend a lot of time working on this task. But we encourage you to implement an efficient pipeline, that's easy to reproduce and pick up.
